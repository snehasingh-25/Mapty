Mapty
This project is a web-based Workout Tracker application that allows users to log running and cycling workouts on an interactive map. The application automatically fetches the user's location via the Geolocation API and allows them to add workout details such as distance, duration, and other relevant data. The workouts are then displayed both on the map as markers and in a detailed list view.

Features Interactive Map: Utilizes the Leaflet.js library to show the user's current location on an OpenStreetMap, allowing users to click on any location to log a workout. Workout Types: Supports logging both running and cycling workouts, each with specific metrics: Running: Users can log distance (in km), duration (in minutes), and cadence (in steps per minute). The app also calculates and displays the pace (minutes per kilometer). Cycling: Users can log distance (in km), duration (in minutes), and elevation gain (in meters). The app calculates and displays the speed (km/h). Form Input Validation: Ensures valid inputs for workout data and provides alerts if invalid data is entered. Dynamic Workout Rendering: On Map: Each workout is marked on the map with a corresponding icon (runner or cyclist) and a popup with the workout's description. List View: Workouts are displayed below the form with details like distance, duration, pace (for running), or speed (for cycling). Persistent Data: (Optional feature for future improvement) The app can be extended to save workouts in local storage, allowing users to keep track of their progress over time. How It Works When the user loads the app, the browser requests their geolocation. Users can click anywhere on the map to open a form where they can input workout details. After submitting the form, the workout is added to the map as a marker and displayed in the workout list. Users can click on any workout in the list to zoom to its location on the map.
